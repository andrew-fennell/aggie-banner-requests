# aggie-banner-requests

This program will scrape all data from a Banner server.

## Usage

Configure settings in CONFIG.py if any of your settings are different from the default. If your banner URL or departments are different, those will need to be changed.

The default function that will run is the get_all_courses function. This gets all the data from every single course at the university. This can be changed in the main function if you require something different.

Directories should be made automatically. If you run the program in it's default state, it will create all directories will be made automatically. Each department folder will be filled with the appropriate json files containing course data.
